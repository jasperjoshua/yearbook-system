WE WON THE FIGHT
(by: Leslyn Palad) 

Turn up the volume, we can’t hear
Never thought we’d be standing here.
We’re searching altogether.
Struggling together, side by side
Thought we’d never make it, we cried
We messed up but fought our way back now
We’re stronger.

You’ve guided our way
Taught us to take,
Risks in everything we make.
You’ve made us stay
And now we’re brave
Facing our future.

[Chorus]
Here we are, standing tall
With our heads held high, we gave it all
Through the day and through the night
We picked ourselves, we won the fight.

[Verse 2]
As we look back on times we had
We never thought we’d get this far through the bad.
Through the good times, we felt the best of days.
We gave our all and fought so hard.

With our dreams
And goals in sight
Hand in hand we will strive.
We’ve come so far,
From where we are
Our future now is shining bright

Chorus:
Here we are, standing tall
With our heads held high, we gave it all
Through the day and through the night
We picked ourselves, we won the fight.

[Bridge]
Cause we stand together
And we don’t give up
Yeah we worked hard together
And we can have it all

Chorus:
Here we are, standing tall
With our heads held high, we gave it all
Through the day and through the night
We picked ourselves, we won the fight.

[Repeat 2X]
I can be what I want to be (Here we are)
You can be what you want to be (standing tall)
We can be what we want to be (with our heads held high)
We will be, we will be (we gave it all)

Ohh…
We picked ourselves, we won our fight.
